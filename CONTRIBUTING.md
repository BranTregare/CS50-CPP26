# CONTRIBUTING.md ‚Äî CS50-CPP26

> Thank you for your interest in this project.

This repository reflects my own exploration and reimagining of Harvard CS50 problem sets in **modern C++26**, using a clean and consistent coding style.

While I do **not actively invite contributions**, they are welcome. If you choose to fork, open issues, or submit pull requests, please be aware of the following:

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Formatting

This project does **not include or enforce** a `.clang-format` file.

You are free to:

* Use your own formatting style or tools
* Apply your own `.clang-format` configuration

**However**, all source files in this repo follow my personal formatting style, which is based on Google‚Äôs with some customizations.

> **I maintain a global** `.clang-format` **that formats all my C++ code.**
> This is not part of the repo ‚Äî and contributors are not expected to match it automatically.

## üìê Style Guide (Conventions Used)

| Element               | Style            | Example                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Types (class/struct)  | PascalCase       | `RGBTRIPLE`¬π, `StopWatch`                   |
| Types (conflict-safe) | PascalCase + `_t` | `Arena_t`, `Arena_t_Ptr`                    |
| Public members        | Camel\_Case      | `Parents`, `Alleles`                        |
| Private members       | Camel\_Case\_    | `Parents_`, `Alleles_`                      |
| Constants (primitive) | ALL\_CAPS        | `GENERATIONS`, `INDENT_LENGTH`              |
| Constants (compound)  | Camel\_Case      | `Sepia_Kernel`, `GX_Kernel`                 |
| Variables             | Camel\_Case      | `Row_Pos`, `Pixel_State`, `Identity_Digits` |
| Functions             | snake\_case      | `create_family()`, `print_family()`         |
| Named lambdas         | snake\_case      | `accumulate_even_digits`, `sobel_formula`   |
| Type converters       | TypeA\_to\_TypeB | `CardType_to_size_t`, `Digit_to_uint8_t`    |
| Structured bindings   | Camel\_Case      | `auto& [Blue, Green, Red] = Pixel;`         |

### Notes:

* Structs and data-only types use `struct` (with public access by default).
* Trailing underscores mark **private data members** clearly ‚Äî not Hungarian notation.
* Identifiers (including parameters and public members) use `Camel_Case`.
* Constants are written in ALL\_CAPS only when they are primitive literals (like integers, chars, or booleans) and are usable in constant expressions.
* Compound constant objects ‚Äî including `std::array`, `std::string_view`, and `struct` instances ‚Äî use `Camel_Case`, even if they are `constexpr`.
* Prefer `std::array`, `std::unique_ptr`, and ranges-based logic where appropriate.
* Named lambdas that are used as ordinary functions follow `snake_case`.
* Conversion lambdas from one type to another follow `TypeA_to_TypeB` convention, reflecting precise semantic intent.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PascalCase Type Naming Conflict

Some names in PascalCase conflict with:

- POSIX typedefs (`pthread_t`, `size_t`)
- C++ standard traits/types (`std::int32_t`, `std::byte`)
- Common identifiers in `<cstddef>`, `<type_traits>`, or `<sys/types.h>`

To avoid accidental shadowing or ambiguity:

> **PascalCase types with potential for conflict are suffixed with `_t`.**

For example:

- `Arena_t` is a custom allocator class, avoiding collision with any external `Arena`
- `Arena_t_Ptr` names a `std::unique_ptr` with a custom deleter, avoiding confusion with allocator traits or smart pointer templates

This pattern ensures clarity and long-term maintainability, especially when writing low-level infrastructure (e.g., custom allocators, intrusive containers, etc.).

## üß≠ Contribution Etiquette

* PRs are welcome but may be reworked or rejected if they do not fit the goals of this project.
* This project is educational in nature. Clear structure and correctness matter more than performance.
* Feel free to use the code as a reference, fork, or remix ‚Äî credit is appreciated, but not required.
