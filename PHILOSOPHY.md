# Philosophy

This project reimagines Harvard's CS50 problem sets using modern C++26. It emphasizes correctness, clarity, safety, and performance — not as tradeoffs, but as complementary principles.

The goal is not to hand students pre-digested answers, but to present carefully structured solutions that expose the why as much as the how. Each problem stands on its own: documented, tested, and designed for exploration. When the original CS50 assignment succeeds (as in PS1/credit), that success is amplified; when it falls short (as in PS5/speller), the project provides a better path forward — without compromising on pedagogy.

Although written in C++26, the emphasis is not on novelty but on relevance: standard containers, value semantics, compile-time guarantees, and STL idioms are used where they clarify, not where they merely impress.

The work is informed by decades of professional experience, tempered by a desire to make that experience teachable.

This project carries forward the mindset born from constrained systems, where performance wasn’t optional — it was survival. Even with today’s abundant compute, clarity, safety, and efficiency are not opposites. They are engineering virtues.

See `TEACHING-INSTRUCTOR.md` for a reflection on why these values still matter.
