## Project Philosophy: Why Rebuild a Trivial Problem?

This project takes the well-known CS50 “Credit” problem — a simple card validator — and reimplements it in modern, idiomatic C++26.

But this is not about making the solution "better" or "faster." Instead, it's about answering a deeper question:

    Can a trivial programming problem become a meaningful exercise in design, safety, and clarity when approached through the lens of modern C++?

What This Project Demonstrates:

- That C++ can be expressive and safe, even in small, beginner-friendly domains.
- That compile-time programming can be used not only for performance, but for correctness and constraint enforcement.
- That unit testing, modular design, and type safety are not luxuries — they scale even to the smallest programs.
- That teaching and showcasing modern C++ doesn't require complex problems — only clear intent.

Why Start with CS50’s “Credit”?

Many learners encounter this problem first in C, and later again in Python. Python’s revisit is often used to show how expressive high-level languages can be.

This project says:
    C++ can be just as expressive, safe, and understandable — when written well.

It’s a didactic and demonstrative effort, intended to model good habits and modern language features in a context learners already understand.
