# Teaching Notes – Student Edition 

This project is a modern C++26 reimagining of the classic CS50 "Credit" problem.

You already know the original version — it asks you to validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm and identify its type (AMEX, MASTERCARD, or VISA).

Now you're doing the same thing using **modern C++ features** like `constexpr`, ranges, and strong typing — not to overcomplicate the problem, but to **explore good design in a familiar space**.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Show that **even small programs deserve good engineering**
- Introduce students to **safe, modular, and modern C++**
- Encourage curiosity and experimentation with modern tools

---

## ✅ What This Project Demonstrates

- That C++ can be **expressive and safe**, even in small beginner-friendly domains
- That **compile-time programming** can enforce correctness and constraints
- That testing, modularity, and **type safety** scale even to small exercises
- That writing clear, modern C++ code doesn’t require a large or complex problem

---

## 🛑 What This Project Avoids

- No CI, no build complexity — keep it approachable
- No C++ modules (not yet fully supported in compilers)
- No real-world card validation (this is **didactic**, not secure)

## 🔍 CS50 C Version vs. This Modern C++26 Version

| Feature              | CS50 (C Version)          | This Project (Modern C++26)               |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Input Handling       | `get_long_long()`         | `std::getline` + manual validation        |
| Luhn Implementation  | Manual loops              | Ranges, views, transforms                 |
| Digit Access         | Division-based indexing   | `DigitSequence` (reversed, type-safe)     |
| Type Safety          | `long long`, `int`        | `uint64_t`, `uint8_t`, `enum class`       |
| Card Type Output     | `printf` string literal   | `enum class` + `std::println`             |
| Static Validation    | None                      | `constexpr`, `static_assert`              |
| Unit Testing         | Manual or none            | Compile-time + Catch2 runtime tests       |

## ✨ Tips for Exploring

- Try changing the validation logic — what fails?
- Add support for Discover or other card types
- Uncomment static tests in `credit_test.cxx` and watch what the compiler does
- Experiment with the `stopwatch.hxx` utility — it’s safe to ignore or explore!

You're not just solving a problem — you're learning to design, validate, and express intent clearly. That’s the heart of modern C++.

Enjoy the journey!
