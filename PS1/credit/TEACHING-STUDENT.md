# Teaching Notes – Instructor Edition

This is a modern C++26 reimplementation of the CS50 “Credit” problem.

It serves as a demonstration of **design-minded programming**, even in a beginner-friendly exercise. The intent is not to "optimize" or "complicate" — but to teach **clarity, modularity, safety, and testability** using modern C++ idioms.

---

## 🎯 Teaching Goals

- Make strong C++ habits visible and teachable in a small codebase
- Highlight benefits of compile-time checks, modularity, and clean input handling
- Reinforce that **good code structure** matters even for "trivial" problems

---

## ✅ What This Project Demonstrates

- **Safe-by-construction design** using strong types and `constexpr`
- Input validation without opaque functions (replaces `get_long_long()`)
- Reverse-iteration Luhn logic using ranges/views for clarity
- Unit testing that scales: static tests + Catch2 runtime coverage
- That compile-time errors can be a **feature**, not a failure

---

## 🛑 What This Project Avoids

- No fragile or incomplete C++ module support — not yet ready for students
- No CI/CD — outside scope for most CS50 learners
- No reliance on undefined behavior or implementation quirks

---

## 📊 Comparison with CS50’s Original C Version

| Feature              | CS50 (C Version)          | This Project (Modern C++26)               |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Input Handling       | `get_long_long()`         | `std::getline` + manual validation        |
| Luhn Implementation  | Manual loops              | Ranges, views, transforms                 |
| Digit Access         | Division-based indexing   | `DigitSequence` (reversed, type-safe)     |
| Type Safety          | `long long`, `int`        | `uint64_t`, `uint8_t`, `enum class`       |
| Card Type Output     | `printf` string literal   | `enum class` + `std::println`             |
| Static Validation    | None                      | `constexpr`, `static_assert`              |
| Unit Testing         | Manual or none            | Compile-time + Catch2 runtime tests       |

## 🧪 Suggestions for Student Exploration

- Break the `validate_card_number()` logic — and explain the result
- Extend the enum to support Discover or other prefixes
- Discuss why reversed digit order simplifies Luhn's rule
- Encourage students to run timing benchmarks with the `StopWatch` class — even if results aren’t meaningful yet

By inviting students to **explore design and safety**, we help them level up — not by complexity, but by clarity.

Small problem. Big opportunity.
