# Credit Card Validator – CS50 Problem Set 1 (Modern C++26 Edition)

> Part of the [`CS50-CPP26`](https://github.com/BranTregare/CS50-CPP26) repository.

This is a modern C++26 implementation of the **CS50 Problem Set 1: Credit** problem. It validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm and identifies card types (AMEX, MASTERCARD, VISA).

---

## ✨ Purpose

This project is a **didactic and demonstrator implementation**, intended to:

- Showcase how to implement classic CS50 problems in **modern idiomatic C++ (C++26)**.
- Teach **safe input handling**, **compile-time validation**, and **clean modular design**.
- Replace opaque library functions like `get_long_long()` with **transparent, real-world alternatives**.
- Demonstrate **`constexpr`-based logic**, **ranges/views**, and **strong typing**.
- Encourage understanding of the **Luhn algorithm** by reversing the digit sequence for clarity.

## 🔍 What’s Different from CS50’s C Version?

| Feature                  | CS50 (C)                           | This Project (C++26)                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Input Handling           | `get_long_long()` (black box)      | `std::getline` + manual validation       |
| Luhn Implementation      | Manual loops                       | Ranges, views, transforms                |
| Digit Access             | Division-based                     | `DigitSequence` (reversed for clarity)   |
| Type Safety              | Raw `long long`, `int`             | `std::uint64_t`, `std::uint8_t`, enums   |
| Card Type Output         | `printf` string                    | `enum class` + `std::println`            |
| Static Validation        | N/A                                | `constexpr`, `static_assert`             |
| Unit Testing             | Manual                             | Compile-time & Catch2 runtime tests      |

## 🧪 Testing

- **Compile-time:** Includes `static_assert` tests in `credit_test.cxx` to validate logic at build time.
- **Runtime:** Uses [Catch2 v3](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for unit tests in `credit_runtime_test.cxx`.

### Compile-Time Failure as a Feature

In this project, some invalid credit card inputs — such as numbers with more than 16 digits — are caught **at compile time**, not at runtime.

Example: Overlong Input (Compile-Time Error)

This test is intentionally commented out in `credit_test.cxx`:

    // static_assert(test_validate(41111111111111112222ULL) == CardType::INVALID, "Too long");

Why Does This Fail?

Internally, credit card digits are stored in a fixed-size buffer:

    std::array<std::uint8_t, 16> digits_;

When `vectorise_number()` is called on a number with more than 16 digits, it attempts to write past the end of this buffer. Because the logic is marked `constexpr`, this triggers a compile-time failure.

What’s the Benefit?

- No runtime length checks are needed inside the Luhn logic.
- The compiler enforces structural constraints before the program is built.
- It demonstrates a fail-fast and safe-by-construction design.
